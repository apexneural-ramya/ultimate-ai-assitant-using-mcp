Agent Creation: MCPAgent is initialized with the LLM and MCP client in the backend, stored with a session ID.\n6. Query Processing: User queries from Next.js are sent to POST /api/mcp/query endpoint with the session ID.\n7. Tool Execution: The agent determines which MCP tools to use and calls appropriate MCP servers (Firecrawl for web scraping, Ragie for RAG).\n8. Response Generation: Results from MCP tools are synthesized by the LLM into a coherent response.\n9. Standardized Response: Backend wraps the response in standardized format with status_code, status, message, path, and data fields.\n10.
